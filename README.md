## みて

みて is an all-in-one application for interacting with Japanese text from visual content.

みて is aimed towards English speakers who are learning Japanese through visual content such as manga,
visual novels, video games, Japanese-subtitled videos, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> The main thing みて _doesn't_ target are webpages; for these you should strongly consider using
> excellent tooling native to the browser such as Yomichan or 10ten.
> However, みて _will probably work_ for browsers, if you really want to use it;
> it's just not an explicit goal of the software (for now).

## installation

_TBD once the service is actually written..._

## self hosting

みて is an open-source all-in-one platform, so you can run it yourself if you want.
It does take some technical know-how to do so though- if you want an easier time,
and want to support the project, consider subscribing to the web app version.

That said, you can set みて up for self-hosting with this guide:
