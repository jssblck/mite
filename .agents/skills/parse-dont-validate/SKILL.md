description: Apply Alexis King's "Parse, don't validate" design rule in Mite. Use when adding or reviewing Rust boundary code for TOML, JSON, CLI/env input, eval labels, config, file manifests, OCR metadata, dictionary data, or any function that checks input validity before deeper processing.

# Parse, Don't Validate

Convert weak external inputs into proof-carrying Rust types at the boundary, then make downstream code require those types.

## Workflow

1. Locate the boundary where untrusted or weakly typed data enters: file load, serde decode, CLI/env parsing, generated data, user edits, or capture metadata.
2. Define the downstream representation you wish processing code could require. Prefer enums, non-empty collections, private-field newtypes, maps/sets, bounded numeric wrappers, and checked structs over `String`, `Vec`, `Option`, loose booleans, or comments.
3. Write a parser/refinement constructor that consumes the weaker input and returns the stronger type, such as `parse_eval_spec(EvalSpec) -> Result<CheckedEvalSpec>`.
4. Push the stronger type down into function signatures. If a caller can skip the parse and still typecheck, the design is not done.
5. Keep invalid-input failure in the parse phase. Processing code should not rediscover basic shape errors after it has already acted on the input.
6. For build-time literals or checked-in assets, prefer compile-time or startup-time construction helpers over parse-and-`expect` spread through runtime paths.
7. Run `nudge check Cargo.toml src docs examples build.rs`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and targeted tests.

## Mite Rules

- Do not add `validate* -> Result<()>` or `parse* -> Result<()>` APIs for boundary shape checks. Return the parsed/refined data.
- Treat `Result<()>` functions with suspicion. They are fine for commands or effects with no meaningful value, but not for preserving input knowledge.
- Raw serde structs may exist at the boundary. Name the checked form for what it proves, such as `CheckedEvalSpec`, `CheckedPipelineConfig`, or a domain-specific invariant name.
- If a value is already created inside typed code and no invalid state is representable, do not parse it again. Make the receiving API require the precise type.
- Avoid denormalized representations unless one small module owns synchronization.

## Enforcement

Nudge blocks new Rust functions named `validate*` or `parse*` that return `Result<()>`. Clippy denies `unnecessary_wraps`, which catches functions that claim fallibility without needing it.
